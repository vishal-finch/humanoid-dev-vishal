 * @class MujocoDepthCamera
 * @brief Represents a depth camera in a Mujoco simulation environment.
 *
 * The MujocoDepthCamera class provides functionality to capture camera data, including color images, depth images,
 * and point clouds, from a Mujoco simulation environment. It uses the Mujoco physics engine for rendering and simulation,
 * and ROS 2 for communication and coordination with other nodes.
 *
 * The class allows for continuous capturing and publishing of camera data based on a specified frequency. It supports
 * setting camera intrinsics, retrieving RGB-D buffers from OpenGL, generating color point clouds, and publishing camera
 * information, color images, depth images, and point cloud data. It provides methods for updating the camera data and
 * releasing resources when the camera is no longer needed.
 *
 * The class utilizes several dependencies, including rclcpp for ROS 2 integration, GLFW for window management, and PCL and
 * OpenCV for point cloud and image processing. It provides various member variables and methods to handle camera-related
 * data and operations.
